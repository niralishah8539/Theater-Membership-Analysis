# Theater-Membership-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves an analysis of customers from a theatre membership program to identify factors that impact conversion from free to paid membership. Analyse age group indicators, gender, income range, home market value range, presence of children, Opt-in indicators for emails, SMS, mobile offers, Lifetime rewards, ticket and concession purchases, online fee waivers, and frequent theatre visits. The aim is to find actionable insights through descriptive and predictive analytics. 

## Goals
* Clean, prepare, organize, and handle missing data, outliers, and incorrect records.
* Identify which customers are likely to convert to a premier membership.
* Understand the behaviours and characteristics of the current paid members.
* Analyze the impact of various demographic and behavioural features on membership conversion.
* Build a predictive model to highlight the most influential features driving membership upgrades.
  
## Usage
* Data quality assessment and preprocessing.
* Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature investigation
* predictive modeling using classification techniques to determine upgrade likelihood.

## Key Findings
* The customers who are likely to upgrade to Premier (ISPREMIER) are mostly in the 35 to 60 age group
* Those with incomes of 100,000 - 124,999 and greater than $124,999 are more likely to convert Premier memberships.
* People without children are more likely to upgrade to Premier.
* INSIDER are the most frequently visited theatre compared to ISPREMIER.
* In the age of 23 to 30, people used their INSIDER membership the most.

## Technologies Used
* Programming Languages: Python
* Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn 
* Tools: Jupyter Notebook

## Insights
These findings help theatres better understand their customer base and target marketing or engagement efforts toward users most likely to benefit from paid membership.
